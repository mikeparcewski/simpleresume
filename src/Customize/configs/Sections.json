We achieve this by fostering a culture of collaboration - a place where people feel comfortable working together and encouraged to share their ideas, no matter who they are or what their role is.  This has been one of the biggest factors of my success and the most important ingredient to any team you'll ever build.",

Over the years I’ve worked with and for some amazing people and organizations who were early adapters of new methodologies, technologies and ways of thinking about product development.

Do you use the same knife to cut everything in your kitchen? Hammers go good with nails, but not with screws. What your teams need is someone who has worked across a lot of technologies. Had their hands dirty and code and configuration and understands the importance of quality and security.",
